# London-Accidents-Flow-Web-App

This is a refactor project of a web application to explore the vehicle accident-flow relationship in London (developed for my undergrad thesis in 2016). 

Moving from:
- Front-End:
  - JQuery, AJAX -> React
- Server:
  - Flask -> FastAPI
- Database:
  - MongoDB -> SQLite
 
Will also include proper package management (npm,pip) and containerised deployment via [render](https://render.com).
